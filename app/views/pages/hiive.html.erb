      Working in a team of 4, we built hiive in two weeks as our final project of the 9-week <a href="http://www.lewagon.com" class="text-btn-red">Le Wagon</a> bootcamp.

      hiive allows content creators to instantly transform the referral links* they post on their channels into an online store. Creating a better shopping experience for their audience (and more revenue for them).

      After creating an account, creators add products to their store by pasting as many referral links as they like at one. Valid URLs are matched with regex, so the inputted text can include description copy, spaces, and random symbols.

      If the referral link doesn't work, the product can be inputted manually. But where's the fun in that?

      A Sidekick background job visits each submitted link and scrapes relevant product information with Nokogiri. Image URLs are stored in the PostreSQL database and then uploaded to <a href="https://www.cloudinary.com/" class="text-btn-red" target="blank">Cloudinary</a> using <a href="https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave" class="text-btn-red" target="blank">Carrierwave</a>.

     This presented our first serious roadblock, as Amazon has measures in place to prevent this kind of activity. But we found a work-around by passing (legitimate-looking) headers with our HTTP GET request.

      A custom hiive URL is created for each store. Now creators can share a single neat link, instead 20 ugly blue referral links cluttering up their content.

     We built a hiive API to return the products currently available in a creator's store. We periodically call this API to instantly add new product cards to the store as they're added to the database.

      When a user clicks 'BUY', they're taken to the original referal link containing the creator's unique referral key, so they still earn their commission.
