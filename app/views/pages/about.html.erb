      My love of problem solving lead me to attend <a href="http://www.lewagon.com" class="text-btn-red-sm">Le Wagon</a> Amsterdam (batch #259) to learn how to build my own ideas. I didn't know where it would lead, only it was something I knew I had to do.
      <br>
      After day one, I was hooked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, armed with a my <a href="/resume.pdf" class="text-btn-red-sm">shiny new web developer toolkit</a>, I have a burning desire to continue coding, building ideas, and learning. Currently, I'm learning React & Redux.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm looking to incorporate my <br><a href="/resume.pdf" class="text-btn-red-sm">7+ years of creative problem solving experience</a> into a full stack Ruby on Rails developer position.
